Foundation for Emails (previously known as Ink) is a framework for creating responsive HTML emails that work in any email client &mdash; even Outlook. Our HTML/CSS components have been tested across every major email client to ensure consistency.

## Compatibility

Foundation for Emails is battle-tested in the trickiest email clients, like Microsoft Outlook. More on [compatibility table](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails/docs/compatibility.html)
